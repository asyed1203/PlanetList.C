# PlanetList.C

//This project here is one of my final projects in class. I call it the Planet List Index. In this program the user is given a menu of
1.) Add a planet
2.) Delete a planet
3.) Find a planet
4.) Display a Planet
5.) Sort Planets
6.) Quit

// Once they enter in a choice they will be allow to use that option.
//Once they choose they can delete, search for it, or display all of them in Alphabetical order (which is what the sort function does).
//This is a very unique program because it can be used not only for Planets, but for banking information which is confidential or even to keep information like on personal contact info like SSN, 
//or even general information. 
// Another unique feature is that it prints the data of the previous and current run of the program onto a different file. This helps because the data isn't lost then.
